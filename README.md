## What is it?

A simple desktop tool that lets you create, view, and manage a digital list of books.

## Uses

Perhaps you have a lot of books and you would like to digitize them.
Perhaps you want to create a list of books you would like to read, buy, or whatever the case may be.

Regardless, this tool makes it easy.

Simply import a list of ISBNs (TODO: eventually have some method of scanning the books to import the ISBNS.. not sure) and watch as our tool collects all of the information about the books you've collected and organizes into a easy to view list.
